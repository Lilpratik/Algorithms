# The Boyer-Moore algorithm skips sections of the text based on mismatched characters from the end of the pattern. It uses two tables:

# Bad Character Table: Determines how far to skip when a mismatch occurs.
# Good Suffix Table: Helps in cases where a partial match of the pattern is found at the end.
# This algorithm is best for longer patterns and is efficient in large texts.

# Steps:
# Preprocess: Create tables for bad character and good suffix rules.
# Start matching from the end of the pattern.
# If thereâ€™s a mismatch, use the tables to decide how far to skip.
# Example (Concept)
# If the text is ABABABCA and the pattern is ABA, the algorithm can skip more characters whenever mismatches occur based on bad character and good suffix rules.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lilpratik/Algorithms.git
   cd Algorithms

2. **📌 Roadmap
Add more LeetCode solutions regularly.
Implement advanced algorithms:
String algorithms (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp).
Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A*).
Include implementations in other languages like Python and Java.
